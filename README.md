# Kattis-Problems

This repository is similar to the Codeforces solution repository that I have set up.

# About Kattis

Kattis (https://open.kattis.com/) is similar to Codeforces in that it's an online programming competition and problem-solving platform that allows people to practice and improve their programming skills. It has a collection of programming challenges of varying difficulty levels, covering a wide range of topics and algorithms.

# This Repo:

In this repository, I'll be storing my solutions to problems as a way to showcase my growth as a competitive programmer. 

I'll be writing most of my solutions in Python as I don't feel comfortable writing in C++ just yet.
